### Using HPE MapR Data Fabric Storage Container


<h3><img src="/graphics/textbubble.png?raw=true" style="max-width:100%;"> About This Lab</h3>

<p>Welcome to this Lab on HPE CSI Driver for Kubernetes with MapR Data Fabric Storage and SQL Server 2019 Lab.</p>
<p>Kubernetes  allows you to create and manage containers. From a perspective of SQL Server, kubernetes provides:</p>
<uL>
    <li>A scalable architecture to deploy containerized applications and data platforms such as SQL Server</li>
   <li> Persistent storage for stateful containers like SQL Server</li>
    <li>Built-in load balancers to abstract application connections to SQL Server</li>
    <li>Built-in high availability for stateful containers like SQL Server</li>
    <li>An ecosystem for Operators to simplify application deployment and manage high availability</li>
</ul>   
<p>MapR Data fabric or kubernetes benefits : </p>
<uL>
    <li>Persist data for containerized applications</li>
   <li>Scale data and performance as containers grow</li>
    <li>Benefit from MapR tickets, for end-to-end security</li>
    <li>Multi-tenant deployment and access</li>
</ul>   

<p>The purpose of this demo is to show you how to use the MapR storage function for SQL Server in a kubernet environment.</p>
